Player block/chunk position is needed constantly. Make one script to stay updated on what they are. Maybe make it even trigger the scripts
that need to execute when the player has moved to a new block/chunk.


Check whether the main thread needs to access the WorldInitializer.chunkArray often,
 since it's being locked by the moving infinite map it could be what is sometimes stutterin' up the game.


If something sucks really bad, check if there are problems with integer divisions since most of chunkSize thingeys are now integers not floats.



!!!Check if setting max threads to 4 improves performance, since then the unity/mainthread can use it's whole core
to calculating unity stuff, and doesn't have to calculate other stuff because of having more threads than cores.
